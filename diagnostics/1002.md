Occurs when there is an unterminated string literal somewhere. String literals
must be enclosed by single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

Often, it caused by an attempt to use a string literal over multiple lines:

```js
const str = "Here is some text
  that I want to break
  across multiple lines.";
```

## Multiple lines

If you are trying to break a string across multiple lines, you can use
[template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
using the backtick (`\``) instead:

```js
const str = `Here is some text
  that I want to break
  across multiple lines.`;
```

Or you can use string concatenation:

```js
const str = "Here is some text" +
  "that I want to break" +
  "across multiple lines.";
```

Or you can use a backslash (`\`) at the end of the line:

```js
const str = "Here is some text \
  that I want to break \
  across multiple lines.";
```
