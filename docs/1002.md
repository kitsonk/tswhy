If you didn't just forget a quote, this error usually occurs when trying to create a multiline string.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2304 1002 1002 1434
const text = 'one
two'
```

This is an error since strings enclosed by `'` or `"` must be closed on the same line as the start of the string, unless the newline is escaped.

To fix this error, use template literals, place a backslash just before the new line, or concatenate multiple strings together.

### Template literals

```ts twoslash
const text = `one
two`
```

### Backslash

```ts twoslash
const text = 'one\
two'
```

### Concatenation

```ts twoslash
const text = 'one' +
  'two'
```
